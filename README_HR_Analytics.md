# 📘 HR Analytics Project – Exploring Engagement and Wellbeing

This project explores employee engagement and wellbeing using SPSS statistical methods. Drawing from a real-world HR dataset, the goal is to understand how factors such as gender, workload, and wellbeing relate to engagement and productivity. This analysis is framed to inform evidence-based decisions within an organizational context.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises employee responses across various HR-related dimensions including:
- **Gender**
- **Workload**
- **Wellbeing**
- **Engagement**

All analyses were conducted in **IBM SPSS Statistics**.

## 📊 Statistical Methods Used

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   Summary measures (mean, SD, skewness, kurtosis) were computed for all key variables to assess data distribution and normality.

2. **Independent Samples t-Test**  
   Used to test gender differences in engagement.

3. **Pearson Correlation**  
   Assessed the relationship between workload and wellbeing.

4. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   Modeled engagement as a function of gender, wellbeing, and workload.

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Engagement by Gender**:  
  No statistically significant gender difference was found in engagement levels (p > .05). While females showed slightly higher mean engagement, the difference was not meaningful.

- **Workload vs Wellbeing**:  
  A **significant negative correlation** was identified (r = –0.214, p < .001), suggesting that as workload increases, wellbeing tends to decrease.

- **Predictors of Engagement**:  
  The regression model revealed:
  - Wellbeing had a **strong positive** effect on engagement (β = 0.419, p < .001)
  - Workload had a **small negative** effect (β = –0.111, p = .006)
  - Gender was not a significant predictor

## 📌 Implications

This analysis highlights the importance of employee wellbeing as a critical factor in driving engagement. For HR managers, this suggests:

- Promoting wellbeing initiatives may boost engagement more effectively than reducing workload alone.
- Gender does not require differentiated engagement strategies in this context.
- Workload should still be monitored to maintain sustainable wellbeing.
